Retrieve tidy data from Wikipedia's many APIs

## What's in a name?

**wiki**: There are many wikis, but one dominates the Wikiverse. [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) is the largest repository of facts ever assembled by human hands. Scholars the world over are turning to Wikipedia to understand how twenty-first century society udnerstands and communicates about itself.

**quiddity**: [The 'whatness' of a thing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiddity). The kind of thing it is. [What is Wikipedia?](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT) Is it merely another encyclopaedia? It is news presented as history? Is it the consensus of a global village, or the battleground of an ideological war?

**tidy**: The best kind of data. R programmers are lucky to have access to the [tidyverse](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01686), a collection of packages that make it easy to analyse, visualise and publish data. This package embodies [tidy data principles](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) by returning results from Wikipedia's APIs as tibbles or simple vectors, and by providing a number of vectorised analysis functions that can be applied reliably and without fuss to the data you retrieve.

Thus `wikkitidy`'s aim: to help you work out what Wikipedia is with the minimal of data wrangling and cleaning.
